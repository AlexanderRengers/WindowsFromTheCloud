# WindowsFromTheCloud
A cloud pc on my iPad, spinning up with the touch of a button.

# Goal
I want my iPad to replace my private laptop. As I don't often need a private laptop and when only for 
 1. browsing the web
 2. playing games

I thought it cheaper to spin up a vm in Azure on a pay-per-use basis.

# Setup
